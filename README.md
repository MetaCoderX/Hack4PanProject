### About

This is a full stack project that comprises a e-commerce website with a chat functionality using gun js. Currently, the chat only allow people to login and chat inside the public room rather than dm/pm. THe ecommerce website allows people to add products to cart which will then be shown in the database. The website is not completed, but will add a dashboard feature probably in the future to allow users to access all order history in the customized dashboard, and admin to see all the orders.

### Run

Clone this repository, change to the directory and run ```npm test``` after running ```npm i``` successfully. Go to localhost:3000 and you should see the website.
* Alternatively, I can also generate a ngrok url.
